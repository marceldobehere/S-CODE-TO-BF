# S-CODE-TO-BF
make writing Brainfuck code a lot simpler!

I am currently working on a Project in Scratch ( https://scratch.mit.edu/ ) that translates/compiles S-CODE (simple(-ish) programming language I created inside of Scratch, based around making BF CODE) into a valid and (relatively) short Brainfuck Code.
## Links
#### Here is the Project:

```
#### Here is an Intepreter I made that runs BF-CODE:

### Variables

Let's start with some basic Variables.  
  
To set up a Variable for later use, just use int.  

```
int Test
```
To set a Variable to a value, use set.  
```
set Test 100
```
To set a Variable to another Variable, use copy.  
```
copy Test Test2
```
To do Math with two variables, use math.  
Note: The output will get set to the first Variable.  
Supported Operations are Addition(+) Subtraction(-) Multiplication(star symbol) Floor Division(slash)  
```
math Test * Test2
```
