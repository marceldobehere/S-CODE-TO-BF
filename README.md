# S-CODE-TO-BF
make writing Brainfuck code a lot simpler!

I am currently working on a Project in Scratch ( https://scratch.mit.edu/ ) that translates/compiles S-CODE (simple(-ish) programming language I created inside of Scratch based around making BF CODE) into valid and (relatively) short Brainfuck Code.
